- Learn how to handle user input.
- Practice using mathematical formulas in programming.
- Gain experience with command-line applications.

## Features

- Calculate the surface area of a sphere.
- Calculate the volume of a sphere.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Error handling for invalid input.

## Installation

To get started with the Sphere Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
